# 🚀 Data Science Project

This project aims to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms (KNN, Decision Trees, Gaussian Naive Bayes) on a classification problem. Various visualization and metrics are used to compare the success of the algorithms.

## 📂 Project Content

- **🔍 KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: Sensitivity scores for different numbers of neighbors (K) are analyzed.
- **🌲 Decision Trees**: Models are trained with "Gini" and "Entropy" criteria, and their performances are compared.
- **📊 Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)**: Model performance is compared with other algorithms.
- **📈 Performance Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - 📚 Scikit-learn: Modeling and performance metrics
  - 🎨 Matplotlib: Visualization
  - 🔢 NumPy: Data processing
